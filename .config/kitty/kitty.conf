### Fonts

font_family      Roboto Mono
font_size 16.0

adjust_column_width -1

#: Change the size of each character cell kitty renders. You can use
#: either numbers, which are interpreted as pixels or percentages
#: (number followed by %), which are interpreted as percentages of the
#: unmodified values. You can use negative pixels or percentages less
#: than 100% to reduce sizes (but this might cause rendering
#: artifacts).

### Cursor customization

cursor_shape block

#: The cursor shape can be one of (block, beam, underline). Note that
#: when reloading the config this will be changed only if the cursor
#: shape has not been set by the program running in the terminal.

### Mouse

copy_on_select yes

#: Copy to clipboard or a private buffer on select. With this set to
#: clipboard, simply selecting text with the mouse will cause the text
#: to be copied to clipboard. Useful on platforms such as macOS that
#: do not have the concept of primary selections. You can instead
#: specify a name such as a1 to copy to a private kitty buffer
#: instead. Map a shortcut with the paste_from_buffer action to paste
#: from this private buffer. For example::

#:     map cmd+shift+v paste_from_buffer a1

#: Note that copying to the clipboard is a security risk, as all
#: programs, including websites open in your browser can read the
#: contents of the system clipboard.

### Terminal bell

enable_audio_bell no

### Window layout

window_margin_width 0 5 0 5

#: The window margin (in pts) (blank area outside the border). A
#: single value sets all four sides. Two values set the vertical and
#: horizontal sides. Three values set top, horizontal and bottom. Four
#: values set top, right, bottom and left.

hide_window_decorations yes

#: Hide the window decorations (title-bar and window borders) with
#: yes. On macOS, titlebar-only can be used to only hide the titlebar.
#: Whether this works and exactly what effect it has depends on the
#: window manager/operating system. Note that the effects of changing
#: this setting when reloading config are undefined.

### Tab bar

tab_bar_edge bottom

#: Which edge to show the tab bar on, top or bottom

tab_bar_style separator

#: The tab bar style, can be one of: fade, separator, powerline, or
#: hidden. In the fade style, each tab's edges fade into the
#: background color, in the separator style, tabs are separated by a
#: configurable separator, and the powerline shows the tabs as a
#: continuous line. If you use the hidden style, you might want to
#: create a mapping for the select_tab action which presents you with
#: a list of tabs and allows for easy switching to a tab.

### Color scheme

background_opacity 1.0

#: The opacity of the background. A number between 0 and 1, where 1 is
#: opaque and 0 is fully transparent.  This will only work if
#: supported by the OS (for instance, when using a compositor under
#: X11). Note that it only sets the background color's opacity in
#: cells that have the same background color as the default terminal
#: background. This is so that things like the status bar in vim,
#: powerline prompts, etc. still look good.  But it means that if you
#: use a color theme with a background color in your editor, it will
#: not be rendered as transparent.  Instead you should change the
#: default background color in your kitty config and not use a
#: background color in the editor color scheme. Or use the escape
#: codes to set the terminals default colors in a shell script to
#: launch your editor.  Be aware that using a value less than 1.0 is a
#: (possibly significant) performance hit.  If you want to dynamically
#: change transparency of windows set dynamic_background_opacity to
#: yes (this is off by default as it has a performance cost). Changing
#: this setting when reloading the config will only work if
#: dynamic_background_opacity was enabled in the original config.

### Advanced

update_check_interval 0

#: Periodically check if an update to kitty is available. If an update
#: is found a system notification is displayed informing you of the
#: available update. The default is to check every 24 hrs, set to zero
#: to disable. Changing this option by reloading the config is not
#: supported.

term xterm-kitty

#: The value of the TERM environment variable to set. Changing this
#: can break many terminal programs, only change it if you know what
#: you are doing, not because you read some advice on Stack Overflow
#: to change it. The TERM variable is used by various programs to get
#: information about the capabilities and behavior of the terminal. If
#: you change it, depending on what programs you run, and how
#: different the terminal you are changing it to is, various things
#: from key-presses, to colors, to various advanced features may not
#: work. Changing this option by reloading the config will only affect
#: newly created windows.

### OS specific tweaks

macos_option_as_alt yes # to make emacs M-x work in macos

#: Use the option key as an alt key. With this set to no, kitty will
#: use the macOS native Option+Key = unicode character behavior. This
#: will break any Alt+key keyboard shortcuts in your terminal
#: programs, but you can use the macOS unicode input technique. You
#: can use the values: left, right, or both to use only the left,
#: right or both Option keys as Alt, instead. Changing this setting by
#: reloading the config is not supported.

### Keyboard shortcuts

#: Keys are identified simply by their lowercase unicode characters.
#: For example: ``a`` for the A key, ``[`` for the left square bracket
#: key, etc. For functional keys, such as ``Enter or Escape`` the
#: names are present at https://sw.kovidgoyal.net/kitty/keyboard-
#: protocol/#functional-key-definitions. For a list of modifier names,
#: see: GLFW mods <https://www.glfw.org/docs/latest/group__mods.html>

#: On Linux you can also use XKB key names to bind keys that are not
#: supported by GLFW. See XKB keys
#: <https://github.com/xkbcommon/libxkbcommon/blob/master/include/xkbcommon/xkbcommon-
#: keysyms.h> for a list of key names. The name to use is the part
#: after the XKB_KEY_ prefix. Note that you can only use an XKB key
#: name for keys that are not known as GLFW keys.

#: Finally, you can use raw system key codes to map keys, again only
#: for keys that are not known as GLFW keys. To see the system key
#: code for a key, start kitty with the kitty --debug-input option.
#: Then kitty will output some debug text for every key event. In that
#: text look for ``native_code`` the value of that becomes the key
#: name in the shortcut. For example:

#: .. code-block:: none

#:     on_key_input: glfw key: 65 native_code: 0x61 action: PRESS mods: 0x0 text: 'a'

#: Here, the key name for the A key is 0x61 and you can use it with::

#:     map ctrl+0x61 something

#: to map ctrl+a to something.

#: You can use the special action no_op to unmap a keyboard shortcut
#: that is assigned in the default configuration::

#:     map kitty_mod+space no_op

#: You can combine multiple actions to be triggered by a single
#: shortcut, using the syntax below::

#:     map key combine <separator> action1 <separator> action2 <separator> action3 ...

#: For example::

#:     map kitty_mod+e combine : new_window : next_layout

#: this will create a new window and switch to the next available
#: layout

#: You can use multi-key shortcuts using the syntax shown below::

#:     map key1>key2>key3 action

#: For example::

#:     map ctrl+f>2 set_font_size 20

#: The full list of actions that can be mapped to key presses is
#: available here </actions>.

kitty_mod ctrl+shift

#: The value of kitty_mod is used as the modifier for all default
#: shortcuts, you can change it in your kitty.conf to change the
#: modifiers for all the default shortcuts.

### Clipboard

map kitty_mod+c copy_to_clipboard

#: There is also a copy_or_interrupt action that can be optionally
#: mapped to Ctrl+c. It will copy only if there is a selection and
#: send an interrupt otherwise. Similarly, copy_and_clear_or_interrupt
#: will copy and clear the selection or send an interrupt if there is
#: no selection.

map kitty_mod+v paste_from_clipboard
map kitty_mod+s paste_from_selection
map kitty_mod+o pass_selection_to_program

#: You can also pass the contents of the current selection to any
#: program using pass_selection_to_program. By default, the system's
#: open program is used, but you can specify your own, the selection
#: will be passed as a command line argument to the program, for
#: example::

#:     map kitty_mod+o pass_selection_to_program firefox

#: You can pass the current selection to a terminal program running in
#: a new kitty window, by using the @selection placeholder::

#:     map kitty_mod+y new_window less @selection

### Window management

map kitty_mod+enter new_window

#: You can open a new window with the current working directory set to
#: the working directory of the current window using::

map ctrl+alt+enter    launch --cwd=current

### Tab management

map super+1 goto_tab 1
map super+2 goto_tab 2
map super+3 goto_tab 3
map super+4 goto_tab 4
map super+5 goto_tab 5
map super+6 goto_tab 6
map super+7 goto_tab 7
map super+8 goto_tab 8
map super+9 goto_tab 9
